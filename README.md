# Hangman

Hangman is a classic and popular online word guessing game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The game begins with an option to start, read the rules or quit the game.

Once the game has started, the user is prompted to guess a letter, and if they are correct, a message will indicate the correct letter placement, and the gallows and previously guessed letters will be displayed. However, if the user guesses incorrectly, they will receive an incorrect message and the gallows will be updated with a penalty, moving them one step closer to losing the game.

Overall, Hangman is a fun and challenging game that requires both guessing skills and vocabulary knowledge, making it a great way to test your abilities and have fun at the same time.

## How to Play

## User Experience (UX)

Hangman is a classic word guessing game that provides a simple yet entertaining user experience. The user is presented with a blank series of dashes that represent the letters of a mystery word. They have to guess the letters in the word, one at a time. With each correct guess, the letter is revealed in the corresponding position(s). However, with each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman's body is drawn. The user can guess until they either correctly guess the entire word or the hangman is fully drawn, resulting in a loss. The game is easy to learn and provides a good balance of challenge and reward. It is also a great way to improve vocabulary and spelling skills while having fun.
